# Game of CompArch: Cellular Automata and Computing
An exploration of the use of cellular automata to perform complex computations, culminating in the implementation of components of an
Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) in John Conway's Game of Life.

# Documentation
Our [website](https://anushadatar.github.io/game-of-comparch/) (based in the [docs/](https://github.com/anushadatar/game-of-comparch/tree/master/docs) folder) for this project includes visualizations and documentation for the research we did and the intricacies of the work we completed over the course of this project.

# Implementation
The [gol_files/](https://github.com/anushadatar/game-of-comparch/tree/master/gol_files) directory contains building blocks and pieces that we implemented in the [Golly](http://golly.sourceforge.net/) framework over the course of this project. TO visualize them, install golly and run the particular program:

```
sudo apt-get install golly
golly FILENAME.mc
```
