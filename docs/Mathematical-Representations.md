# Mathematically Describing Cellular Automata

One of the hallmarks of cellular automata is that they can be described abstractly. The rules that a system follows can be defined with
functions.

However, despite this low-level mathematical description of these systems, our predictions of their behavior break down over large spatial and
time scales.

Many researchers believe that one of the special properties of the Game of Life -- the one that allows these configurations to happen, and the reason why the Game has been so philosophically and computationally interesting -- is that it lies near the *edge of chaos*. Or, the patterns it produces don't usually tend towards a completely stable state, nor do their results appear to be completely random. The near-ness to the edge of chaos is quantified by a parameter called \lambda, which is the fraction of a cellular automata's rules that lead to the "life" of a cell.
