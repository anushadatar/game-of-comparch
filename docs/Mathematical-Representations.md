# Mathematically Describing Cellular Automata

One of the hallmarks of cellular automata is that they can be described abstractly. The rules that a system follows can be defined with
relatively straightforward state-based models and functions.
The state of a cellular automaton at some point can be defined by: 
**Z** : The *lattice*, or the grid the game is conducted upon. In the case of the game of life, this would refer to t
**S** : The set of *state variables* for each cell.
**N** : The finite *neighborhood*, or cells related to some observed cell.
**F** : The transition *function* associated with the given rule.
A tuple formed by these values defines the state and behavior of a given automaton.

## Neighborhoods 

## Rules and Functions
In general, the local transition function maps an lattice of cells with certain states at some timestep to a new set of cells with certain states based on the function specified by the rule and the existing state of the lattice.
