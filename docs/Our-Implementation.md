# Our Implementation
 
 In order to create the structures of a compute in the game of life, we have to implement physical structures to produce, relay, and modify information. Due to the underlying logic gate structure of computers, we could build almost any structure using a combination of logic gates, traces to connect gates, and voltage sources to drive the inputs for the logic gates.
 
 ## Voltage Sources and Wiring
 In real-life systems, information is transmitted across computers through digital signals: a combination of high and low voltages pread over time. This digital stream of 1s and 0s is emulated in the game of life by the presence or absence of glider in a glider stream.
 
 The following image depicts a glider stream that is transmitting a stream of 1s.

 Information is transmitted in stored by the prescence or abscence of glider streams. The individual glider
